mindcrack-website-modern
========================

A fan-made unsolicited redesign of the Mindcrack website, based off a design by /u/Bloq. 

Mindcrack is a whitelisted Minecraft server, run and played on by various LPers. 

This site is built based on [a design by /u/Bloq](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1nud9s/so_i_made_a_redesigned_mindcrack_website/ccm5geo). It is based on Bootstrap, and is responsive - content will reflow based on the screen width. I'm using a font called [Lato](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato), which is similar to Helvetica Neue used on the original mockup.
